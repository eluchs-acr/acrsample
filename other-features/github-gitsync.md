# Github/Gitsync



{% hint style="warning" %}
The GitHub app that powers our GitHub integration is currently not available to customers on GitHub Enterprise Server instances.

{% hint style="success" %}
There is also a copilot integration that reads your documentation to answer questions about your codebase
{% endhint %}

GitBook has an integration that makes it easy to link documentation directly to a Git repo. It took 5 minutes to set up a brand new repo although integration into an already existing one may be more difficult.\
GitSync documentation: [https://gitbook.com/docs/getting-started/git-sync](https://gitbook.com/docs/getting-started/git-sync)

The repo I synced: [https://github.com/eluchs-acr/acrsample/](https://github.com/eluchs-acr/acrsample/)

## Versioning

GitBook supports versioning through its Git sync feature, which allows documentation to be tied directly to branches in a connected Git repository. This means each version of the documentation can correspond to a specific branch, enabling teams to maintain different sets of docs for different product releases. In addition, this allows documentation to be reviewed by others before being published if needed.
