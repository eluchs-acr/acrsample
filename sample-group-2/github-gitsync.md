# Github/Gitsync



{% hint style="warning" %}
The GitHub app that powers our GitHub integration is currently not available to customers on GitHub Enterprise Server instances.
{% endhint %}

Gitbook has an integration that makes it easy to link documentation directly to a Git repo. It took 5 minutes to set up a brand new repo although integration into an already existing one may be more difficult.\

The repo I synced: [https://github.com/eluchs-acr/acrsample/](https://github.com/eluchs-acr/acrsample/)\
